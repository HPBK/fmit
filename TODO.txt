Add low-pass filter to avoid problems with high sampling rate

Fix bug (voir mail)

 1. Would it be possible to have a celeste offset i.e. where you could add a
 constant value (Hz) to every note: +5Hz to -5Hz , this would be usefull for
 tuning the celeste on the organ!

 2. Would it be possible to have the note names only using sharps i.e. A#, C#,
 D#, F#, G# this is what I have always encountered in the organ building
 world.
 - pouvoir passer d'un naming scheme � l'autre.

 3. I would really like to use fmit. But it doesn't compile with the newest
 version of Jack. It complains about "CaptureThread.cpp:(.text+0x7276):
 undefined reference to `jack_error_callback'". It does compile with an
 older version of Jack, but that version of Jack won't work with the
 version of FFADO that works with my audio interface. Any chance you
 could update fmit to compile with the newest version of Jack?

 4. (voir mail de Jean-Jacques Sacr�): probl�me de chargement d'un
 fichier de traduction. en effet, si PACKAGE_NAME correspond pas au path
 d'installation, �a marche pas. nouveaut� dans la lib qt ?

 5. (voir mail de wayne): implementer le low-pass filter

Two remarks (of details):

    - as also can be seen on your welcome page, to my knowledge, 329.6Hz
is E3 rather than E4: since I remarked this for the whole frequency
range, it's probably due to the lack of a minus one somewhere in an
integer part operation.

    - I found that the default sound level for incoming audio is very
low so that setting is first required before using fmit; possibly, it
would be set higher in the next release.

	Do not use a too big sampling rate. 22050Hz should be largely enough in most cases.
