                    Free Music Instrument Tuner
                          Version 1.0.0
               http://gillesdegottex.github.io/fmit/
</code></pre>

<p>FMIT is a graphical utility for tuning your musical instruments, with error
and volume history and advanced features like microtonal tuning, statistics,
and various views like waveform shape, harmonics ratios and real-time Discrete
Fourier Transform (DFT). All views and advanced features are optional so that
the interface can also be very simple.</p>

<p>This software is coded in C/C++ using the Qt library (<a href="http://qt-project.org">http://qt-project.org</a>).
It is stored as a GitHub project (<a href="https://github.com/gillesdegottex/fmit">https://github.com/gillesdegottex/fmit</a>).
(It was previously stored on gna.org (<a href="https://gna.org/projects/fmit">https://gna.org/projects/fmit</a>)
for versions&lt;=0.99.5).</p>

<p>Goals
    * Estimate the fundamental frequency (f0) of an audio signal, in real-time.
      (the f0, not the perceived pitch)
    * Keep any view optional so that the interface can be as simple as possible.
      (make it easy to see on a distant screen)
    * Support as many sound systems as possible.</p>
