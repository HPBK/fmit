Description: Free Music Instrument Tuner (FMIT)
 is a graphical utility for tuning your musical instruments, with error
 and volume history and advanced features like microtonal tuning, statistics,
 and various views like waveform shape, harmonics ratios and real-time Discrete
 Fourier Transform (DFT). All views and advanced features are optional so that
 the interface can also be very simple.
