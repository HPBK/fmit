All views and advanced features are optional so that\r\nthe interface can also be very simple.\r\n\r\nThis software is coded in C/C++ using the Qt library (http://qt-project.org).\r\nIt is stored as a GitHub project (https://github.com/gillesdegottex/fmit).\r\n(It was previously stored on gna.org (https://gna.org/projects/fmit)\r\nfor versions<=0.99.5).\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n    * Estimate the fundamental frequency (f0) of an audio signal, in real-time.\r\n      (the f0, not the perceived pitch)\r\n    * Keep any view optional so that the interface can be as simple as possible.\r\n      (make it easy to see on a distant screen)\r\n    * Support as many sound systems as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2004 Gilles Degottex <gilles.degottex@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n    Most of the code of this software is under the GPL (v2) License.\r\n    See the file COPYING_GPL.txt or http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html\r\n\r\n    Some abstract or helper classes are under LGPL (v2.1).\r\n    See the file COPYING_LGPL.txt or http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html\r\n\r\n    The internal libs of this software (see directories in libs) are also under\r\n    the LGPL (v2) License (see the respective directory for more details).\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n    THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\r\n    AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\r\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\r\n    ARE DISCLAIMED.
