                        Compilation & Installation


Necessary libraries
    Qt5 packages (e.g. qt5-default on Ubuntu)
    FFTW3 for the FFT (libfftw3-dev)

Optional libraries (under Linux only)
    The ALSA developpment library for sound input (libasound2-dev)
    The JACK developpment library for sound input (libjack-dev)
    The Portaudio developpment library for sound input (portaudio19-dev)

Deployment ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Releases have to be tagged from github.com
    Otherwise Appveyor does not see the tag.


Under Linux or OSX ------------------------------------------------------------

FMIT currently uses Qt's build system.
You can have a look at the Travis CI's configuration file for a working
compilation procedure.

To compile:

    From fmit package directory, create a directory build:
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

    Configure with the options you want:
    $ qmake-qt5 "CONFIG+=acs_qt acs_alsa acs_jack acs_portaudio" ../fmit.pro
    (depending on your system, qmake, might be named qmake-qt5)

    Compile:
    $ make

    Build the translation files:
    $ make lrelease

And install (as root)
    # make install



Under Windows ------------------------------------------------------------------

For a command line compilation, the best is to look at the Appveyor's
configuration file appveyor.yml. It is complete and self-explanatory.

The distribution packages are built using the Inno Setup program.
They can be built using the script files package_*.sh that runs in the
GitHub console for Windows.
